## Happy Tummy
#### Zero Waste, Zero Hunger

SDGs Considerations

SDG 2: Zero Hunger 

SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, Infrastructure (focusing on using innovative technology to achieve the other sdgs, in this case using AI to tackle SDG 2 and 12.3) 

SDG12: Responsible consumption and Production 
SDG 12.3 : Help AGA with AI to focus on SDG target 12.3 which aims at halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reducing food losses along production and supply chains, including post- harvest losses

## Problem Identification

- Partners making unwanted donations to AGA/NGOs

- Communities and families not receiving what is being requested/needed

- Increasing amount of donations to AGA/NGOs resulting in increasing amount of waste

- Up-trend of communities and families requesting donations throughout COVID-19

- Inefficient utilisation of donations received

- Traditionally these NGOs are not equipped or funded to use the latest AI Data Driven Technology to help provide these services efficiently with the best consumer experience. 

## High-Level Concept Solution

An integrated management platform which will benefit all the parties (AGA/NGOs, Partners, Communities and Families).
Strong analytics and predictions (backed by AI) to understand the trends in demands vs supply:
Identification of unwanted donations
Identification of required order items not being fulfilled
Past/present trends across AGA/NGOs-Partners-Community locations and over period of time 
Real-time predictions of demand - continuously updated by tracking donations from Partners received, and new order for items are requested
Real-time inventory data 
Findings/trends accessible to AGA/NGOs-Partners-Community to allow actionable items 
Work with AGA/NGOs-Partners-Community and provide consulting and advice on actionable items to address issues

## Analytics and Predictions Dashboard

A centralised platform where AGA/NGOs-Partners-Community can tap into their own data to understand the behaviour of the supply/distribution of donations by the partners against the needs of the communities.

The application will provide a dashboard/platform to conveniently and effectively display the various analytics and predictions. The outcome will be actionable items for the AGA/NGOs-Partners-Community to address the issues.
